REVERT A MERGE TO MASTER, AFTER IT HAS BEEN PUSHED

given:

  *   16d572226 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'adp_free_trial_buy_card_2'  Brian, 79 minutes ago
  |\
  | * fcfd4e665 (adp_free_trial_buy_card_2) disable free trial radio button  Brian, 30 hours ago
  | * b58f7db11 adding free trial option to adp buy card  Brian, 4 days ago
  |/
  *   822195aac (tag: RFC0099921) Merge branch 'TitleChange' into 'master'  Jeshua, 2 hours ago

Let's say I pushed this, but found an issue on STAGE on my
adp_free_trial_buy_card_2 branch.  I now need to get that merge off, in a way
that doesn't involve a force push (and thus screw up others that may be
working off 16d572226).  The process is:

  git revert -m 1 16d572226

"-m 1" indicates that I want to revert to the tree of the first parent prior to the merge.

The result is a new commit: f18dc5691

  * f18dc5691 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Revert "Merge branch 'adp_free_trial_buy_card_2'"  Brian, 57 minutes ago
  *   16d572226 Merge branch 'adp_free_trial_buy_card_2'  Brian, 2 hours ago
  |\
  | * fcfd4e665 (adp_free_trial_buy_card_2) disable free trial radio button  Brian, 31 hours ago
  | * b58f7db11 adding free trial option to adp buy card  Brian, 4 days ago
  |/
  *   822195aac (tag: RFC0099921) Merge branch 'TitleChange' into 'master' Jeshua, 3 hours ago

which does not differ from the desired commit:

  bolpin ~/src/unisporkal/asset_detail 2.5.3 master f18dc5691 $ git diff 822195aac
  bolpin ~/src/unisporkal/asset_detail 2.5.3 master f18dc5691 $

yay!
